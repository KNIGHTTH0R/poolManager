poolManager is a way to manage what pools your miners work at easily.

It will not provide automatic mechnisms to pool hop, that will have to be done manually.

Dependencies:
	Pymongo
	
Basis is that this will act as a mining proxy for your workers.
Each worker will connect to this pool with a unique ID, passwords will be optional
and the requirement of them will be set in the admin panel.

You will be able to add pools through python modules, and then you can shift which pool
your workes mine from easily from the admin panel. Note again that the miners will not
hop the pools but stick to a single pool until they are shifted to a new pool.
