poolManager is a way to manage what pools your miners work at easily.

Dependencies:
	Pymongo
	Tornado Web Server
	Some Json Library
	
This project aims to provide a easily extensible and clean interface
to one's bitcoin miners. The inspiration was to extend bitHopper but
this changed to a complete rewrite from scratch as I wanted to provide
my own features and extensions that would not work in the original
bitHopper code thus this project was started.

Features:
	- Pool management:
		- Username and Password changes.
		- Address changes.
		- Port changes.
		- Timeout changes.
	- Miner statistics:
		- 15m, 1day, and 7day hash rate averages.
		- Shares and stales per day.
		- Estimated earnings per miner per pool.
			- This will be a rough estimate and is dependent on
				formula choice and pool target's.
	- Web interface:
		- Admin panel for changing settings on the fly.
		- Failover pool adding.
		- Graphs because graphs are nice.
		
This project is not a pool hopper, although it could be extended to be
one. The default code does not provide this functionality.
